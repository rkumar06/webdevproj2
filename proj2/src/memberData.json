Car singing is way more fun than shower singing because in the car, I really let loose. So I was reaching the climax of a favorite Broadway showstopper, belting with all my heart, when I glanced out my right window. There was a car driving alongside me, and inside was a woman staring at me with an expression that said, “Does he think the car is soundproof?” We locked eyes, sharing the moment when I realized that she was watching me not realize that she heard me. We both looked away quickly. It was awkward for both of us.\n\nThere has to be a moral to this story somehow. Maybe it’s that singing should be emotive without inhibition. Sing for yourself and sing from the heart. Or maybe the moral is that you should never make eye contact with people because if they’re already looking at you it’ll be twice as awkward as not making eye contact. Yeah, I think that’s the moral.",
